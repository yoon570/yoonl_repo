This validator utilizes an ACM-provided API to automatically validate ACM member numbers.
It was used to verify that attendees of the ISCA 2024 conference had valid ACM memberships.
The API used in this file was hidden for privacy reasons, as I am not authorized to disclose the actual API URL.
The validator skims through an Excel spreadsheet generated by the conference registration program Whova.
Following this, it logs any IEEE numbers it comes across, since those could not be validated with the use of automation (IEEE did not provide an API key).
Any ACM numbers that may have been improperly entered or indicated an invalid membership (this was done with a returned JSON object) were logged for further investigation.
